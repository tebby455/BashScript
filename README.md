# Bash Script

Working with Terminal sometimes we use many commands in many times, or doing many steps in same time, `bash script` is a solution for it. We save a file bash script with command we want to use in a folder, directory then run it `./`. In Linux, bash script saved as `.sh`, `.bat` for Windows.
